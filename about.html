        <div class="recent">BRIEF ABOUT ME
            <p class="about-t">Currently, I'm 18 years old, and I finished high school about half a year ago. After a while of learning front-end, I burned out. In the end, I got back to coding, but I figured that front-end wasn't for me. Soon I found out about Data Science, and with my previous passion for science and the realm of interesting things, I found a field I was interested in. I think I would like this field because I love learning new things, and in Data Science, I would learn a lot since there are trillions of GB of data out here.
        
            <br><br>
            It doesn't only limit that, though. I'd be naive if I said my desire isn't impacted by money. The pay in this field is definitely one of the best in the Computer Science Industry.
            Also, after learning Data Science, you can go into many different fields. <br><br>
            </p>

        <div class="recent">PROGRESS
            <p class="about-t">
                
                So far, I've been learning Data Science or coding for about a month when I've been making this website.
                I've learned quite a bit about Data Storage and Cleaning, as well as how to effectively code and think about problem solving.
                I am self-learning at home, and I am trying to put in at least 8 hours a day, and it's been semi-successful. I do code, like now I am coding this site, but I am not working on Data science-related projects.
                But in reality, I have learned quite a lot about coding, even if I haven't been coding DS-related projects most of the time. In a short month, I went from making small-scale games like Hangman and number generators to web scraping and more complicated web scraping.
                to learning about flask applications, how to use and make them, data cleaning, data storage, some SQL and JS, and even how to automate some things and use APIs. I do think I learnt quite a bit, but I could definitely do better, and I will always strive to be my best.

            </p>

        <div class="recent"> GOALS
            <p class="about-t">
                A goal in life would be to be a multi-millionaire, at the very least. Since I don't understand how I can't match up to the thousands of other ordinary people out there who also have a few million,

                <br><br>

                I would also love to learn a lot in life and to understand something that is rarely understood.

                <br><br>

                Another goal of mine would be in the physical aspect. I want to bench 225, and I also want to be decent at MMA or Muay Thai.

        <div class="recent"> HOBBIES
            <p class="about-t">

                <br><br>
                <strong>MMA, Fighting</strong> - I personally don't watch UFC, or the similar, only train in it.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Books + Writing</strong> - Im taking these up as hobbies since they wont do me evil.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Coding</strong> - A passion of mine for sure, I can spend all day coding.

  <!-- <div class="small-words"><p>Words about myself</p></div>
    <p>Im currently self-studying Data Science and am later planning on going into the field of Machine Learning Engineering. I am absolutely enthralled by technology and I see it as a shame I don't have enough time to learn it all.</p> -->
